# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Common questions about building AOSP 15 for Raspberry Pi 5 with the ED-HMI3010-101C display.

## General Questions

### Q: What is AOSP?
**A:** AOSP (Android Open Source Project) is the open-source version of Android, maintained by Google. It's the base code that commercial Android builds (Samsung, Google Pixel, etc.) are based on.

### Q: Why build AOSP instead of using a pre-built image?
**A:** Building from source allows you to:
- Customize Android for your specific needs
- Add custom features or modifications
- Learn how Android works internally
- Create your own Android-based products
- Have full control over updates and security

### Q: How long does the entire process take?
**A:**
- **Setup + Download**: 30 minutes to 2 hours (depends on internet speed)
- **Build**: 2-6 hours (depends on your hardware)
- **Flash**: 5-10 minutes
- **Total**: 3-9 hours (mostly automated)

### Q: Can I use this on other Raspberry Pi models?
**A:** This setup is specifically for Raspberry Pi 5. For other models:
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: Use `aosp_rpi4-bp1a-userdebug` target
- **Raspberry Pi 3 or earlier**: Not officially supported for Android 15

## Hardware Questions

### Q: Will the ED-HMI3010-101C work with other single-board computers?
**A:** The display uses standard HDMI for video, so it can work with any device supporting HDMI output. However, the touch functionality is configured specifically for Raspberry Pi's GPIO/I2C, so touch may not work on other boards without modification.

### Q: Can I use a different display?
**A:** Yes! Any HDMI display will work for video output. For touch displays:
- HDMI/USB touch displays work out-of-the-box
- Other I2C/SPI touch displays need custom device tree overlays

### Q: Do I need exactly 32GB RAM on my build machine?
**A:** No, but:
- **16GB**: Will work with reduced parallel jobs (`make -j4`)
- **32GB**: Comfortable for full parallel builds
- **64GB**: Ideal for fastest builds
- **<16GB**: Possible with swap, but very slow

### Q: What's the minimum SD card size?
**A:** 
- **32GB**: Absolute minimum (tight fit)
- **64GB**: Recommended
- **128GB+**: Comfortable with room for apps and data

### Q: Can I boot from USB or NVMe instead of SD card?
**A:** Yes! Raspberry Pi 5 supports NVMe boot. You'll need to:
1. Update the bootloader
2. Flash the image to NVMe instead of SD card
3. NVMe is much faster than SD cards

## Build Questions

### Q: Do I need to download 100GB every time I build?
**A:** No! You only download once. After that:
- Source code stays on your disk
- Updates are incremental (small)
- Rebuilds use existing code

### Q: Can I pause and resume the download?
**A:** Yes! If `repo sync` is interrupted:
```bash
repo sync  # Resume where it left off
```

### Q: What if my build fails?
**A:** 
1. Check `~/aosp-rpi5/out/error.log` for errors
2. See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for common issues
3. Most failures are due to:
   - Insufficient RAM (reduce parallel jobs)
   - Missing dependencies (reinstall)
   - Disk space (clean old builds)

### Q: How much disk space do I need?
**A:**
- **Download**: ~100GB
- **Extracted**: ~150GB
- **Build output**: ~50-100GB
- **Total**: 100GB minimum, 150GB+ recommended

### Q: Can I build on Windows or macOS?
**A:** 
- **Windows**: No, AOSP requires Linux. Use WSL2 or a VM
- **macOS**: Theoretically possible but not recommended. Use Linux VM
- **Linux**: Yes, Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS recommended

### Q: Can I build in a VM?
**A:** Yes, but allocate enough resources:
- 8+ CPU cores
- 32GB+ RAM
- 100GB+ disk space
- SSD storage highly recommended

### Q: How do I update to a newer Android version?
**A:**
1. Change branch: `repo init -b android-16.0`
2. Sync: `repo sync`
3. Rebuild: `./build-helper.sh build`

## Software Questions
